# 🔐 Password Generator (Python Internship Task)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a **Random Password Generator** developed in Python as part of an internship task.
It generates secure and random passwords based on **user-defined criteria** such as password length and character types.


---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Generate random and secure passwords
* Allow users to customize password length and character types
* Validate user input and handle errors gracefully
* Enforce basic password security rules
* Provide an easy way to copy passwords using clipboard integration

---

## 🔑 Password Generation Logic

Passwords are generated using random selection from different character sets:

* Letters (uppercase & lowercase)
* Numbers (digits)
* Symbols (special characters)

The application ensures randomness while maintaining selected security constraints.

---

## 🛡️ Security Rules

* Minimum recommended password length: **8 characters**
* At least one selected character type is required
* Supports combination of letters, numbers, and symbols for strong passwords

---


## ▶️ How to Run the Project

1. Ensure Python is installed on your system
2. Run the application using the command:

```
python Password_Generator.py
```

---

## ⚠️ Input Requirements

* Password length must be a positive integer
* At least one character type must be selected
* Recommended length is **8 or more characters** for better security

## ✅ Conclusion

This project demonstrates how Python can be used to build a **secure and customizable password generator**.
It combines randomization, security rules, and a user-friendly GUI, making it suitable for real-world usage and internship evaluation.
