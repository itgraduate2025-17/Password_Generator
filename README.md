# 🔐 Random Password Generator (Python Internship Task)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a **Random Password Generator** developed in Python as part of an internship task.
It generates secure and random passwords based on **user-defined criteria** such as password length and character types.

The advanced version of this project is implemented as a **GUI application using Tkinter**, focusing on security, usability, and customization.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Generate random and secure passwords
* Allow users to customize password length and character types
* Validate user input and handle errors gracefully
* Enforce basic password security rules
* Provide an easy way to copy passwords using clipboard integration

---

## 🔑 Password Generation Logic

Passwords are generated using random selection from different character sets:

* Letters (uppercase & lowercase)
* Numbers (digits)
* Symbols (special characters)

The application ensures randomness while maintaining selected security constraints.

---

## 🛡️ Security Rules

* Minimum recommended password length: **8 characters**
* At least one selected character type is required
* Supports combination of letters, numbers, and symbols for strong passwords

---

## 🖥️ Features

* GUI-based application using Tkinter
* Centered application window
* Wide input fields for better usability
* Password length customization
* Character type selection using checkboxes
* Strong password generation logic
* One-click copy to clipboard feature

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Python**
* **Tkinter** (GUI Development)
* **Random & String Modules**
* **Clipboard Integration**
